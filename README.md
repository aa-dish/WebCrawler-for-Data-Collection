# WebCrawler-for-Data-Collection
This web crawler was developed to collect real data for real-time model training.

To ensure website security, in the crawler.py file the main resource is not revealed as well as also not presented any successfully collected data, and changes have been made to the JavaScript IDs to enhance robustness.

In case you would like to know more about this project, you are welcome to contact me via email.

Key Learnings:

- How to inspect a website for crawling

- How to automate large-scale data collection using web mining techniques (web crawling)

The web crawler has been successfully developed!
